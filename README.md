## RUST-POSIX

This is a little project that aims to provide at least some commands that are found in the POSIX command set.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to learn more about Rust and POSIX commands and specifically how those work under the hood. I therefore do not aim to provide a replacement for the existing commands that your operating system provides, nor am I doing this with a fixed schedule.

### Disclaimer

I am not a very experienced Rust programmer so my code may not be following the best practices and a lot of the code is probably badly optimized.

### Commands to be implemented

- LS
- MV
- CP
- CAT

### Commands that are implemented

- None
